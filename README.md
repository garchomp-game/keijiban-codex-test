# keijiban-codex-test

This repository contains documentation and prototype implementations for a realtime bulletin board system. The code is split into
an Angular frontend and a NestJS backend following the design notes in the `docs` directory.

## Backend (NestJS)

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Tests

```
cd backend
npm test
```

## Frontend (Angular)

The frontend is a minimal Angular skeleton.

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

Both applications are placeholders to kickstart development according to the detailed requirements in the docs.
